# Roman Numeral Converter

This Go program converts decimal numbers into Roman numerals. It prompts the user to input a number between 1 and 3999 and then displays the Roman numeral equivalent of that number. The program runs indefinitely until the user decides to exit.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `main.go` file.
2. Make sure you have Go installed on your system.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `main.go` file.
4. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   go run main.go

# Example

Please enter a number between 1 and 3999 (Type 'exit' to quit): 123
The Roman numeral equivalent of 123: CXXIII

Please enter a number between 1 and 3999 (Type 'exit' to quit): 3999
The Roman numeral equivalent of 3999: MMMCMXCIX

Please enter a number between 1 and 3999 (Type 'exit' to quit): exit
Exiting the program... Goodbye!
